# StructureFunctionsWDs
In this repository I provide the Structure Functions for White Dwarfs (WDs) and the fit for the axion and scalar emission rates. More details can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00778.

The present files are as follows. In the two ".dat" files you find the Structure Functions data from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370157387901256?via%3Dihub and https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...273..774I/abstract. In the Mathematica Notebook I extract these data and provide interpolated functions. Then I use them to compute the functions $F_{i}$ which enter the emission rates. I provide simple fitting formulas which are accurate at the % level.
